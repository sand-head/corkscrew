![Build & Publish](https://github.com/sand-head/corkscrew/workflows/Build%20&%20Publish/badge.svg) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@sand_head/corkscrew)

A WIP DOM binding library for [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), built using [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and inspired by [Knockout](https://github.com/knockout/knockout).

This should definitely not be used in any production-critical application.
